				<p>As a Data Science Fellow at CUNY Tech Prep, I will dive into an intensive syllabus focused on data science and machine learning. We'll start with the basics of data science, working with Pandas for data manipulation, and then move on to exploratory data analysis and visualizations. The program will cover key machine learning topics, including classification, linear regression, decision trees, and random forest classifiers. We'll also explore advanced areas like natural language processing, image classifiers, and neural networks. This comprehensive coverage will equip me with the skills to tackle complex data challenges and build effective machine learning models. It is my hope that through this program's first project, I will develop an innovative solution to a real world problem using these skills.</p>

				<p>As a Software Engineering Intern at Emerald Energy, I was responsible for the development of the Retrieval Augmented Generation Chatbot- Emerald Energy's HVAC Copilot. Utilizing OpenAI, I created this chatbot with the intent to instruct deployed HVAC technicians on how to install specific hardware such as heatpumps and air conditioners so that they would never have to scour through 200+ pages of instruction manuals. In a UI that is not too different from mobile texting, we would engage the technicians by asking them clarifying questions which would allow us to go through a decision tree to discover any problems.</p>

				<p>As part of the Break Through Tech AI program, I'm diving deep into data science, machine learning, and data analytical fundamentals. The program covers a wide range of topics, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation techniques. A significant aspect of the program is the AI Studio, where I will collaborate with a partner company to solve real-world problems using AI and machine learning. This hands-on experience will enhance my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges, making a tangible impact in the industry.

				<p>As part of the NYC SYEP Program, I was partnered with the New York City Black Chamber of commerce. I was tasked with designing the website, where I would use Squarespace to design and implement new sections such as an email section. I had also aided the NYCBCC in outreach efforts, resulting in 20+ small businesses learning about and receiving $100,000 in NYS grants.
